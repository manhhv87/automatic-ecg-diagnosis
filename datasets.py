    # @classmethod means: when this method is called, we pass the class as the first argument
    # instead of the instance of that class (as we normally do with methods). This means you can use the class
    # and its properties inside that method rather than a particular instance.
    # The first argument for @classmethod function must always be cls (class).
    #
    # @staticmethod means: when this method is called, we don't pass an instance of the class to it (as we
    # normally do with methods). This means you can put a function inside a class, but you can't access the
    # instance of that class (this is useful when your method does not use the instance).
